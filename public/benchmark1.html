		<div class='section'>Introduction</div>
		<div class='text-body'>
			Our game “Puzzle Knight” is a fantasy-themed top-down RPG game where our main character will have to solve puzzles and fight enemies to reach his goal. The game will make use of sprites, tilemaps, collision detection, AI, and camera-panning.
		</div>
		<div class='section'>Technology</div>
		<div class='text-body'>
			Puzzle Knight will be made using Wolfie-2D, a 2D game engine created by Richard McKenna. DirectX is being used for rendering, and our pixel art will be made with Piskel. Music and sound will be made with Audacity and GarageBand.

		<div class='section'>Backstory</div>
		<div class=text-body>
			The Puzzle Knight is a brave and intelligent warrior, sworn by oath to protect the kingdom’s royal family. While our hero was off on an important mission, dragons launched an assault on the kingdom and escaped with the royal princess. When our hero returned from his mission and heard what happened, he sprung into action. Puzzle Knight made his way to the entrance of the Lair of Dragons, determined to bring the princess to safety...

		<div class='section'>Gameplay</div>
		<div class='text-body'>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Traversing the map is a large part of the game as the map itself acts as a puzzle.
				</li>
				<li>
					Interacting with objects like chests/doors may require the completion of a puzzle.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enemies like goblins/skeletons are located throughout the map, and the player will use a variety of weapons(knives/swords/bows) to defeat them
				</li>
				<li>
					Defeating enemies awards XP, which levels the player and awards skill points
				</li>
				<li>
					Skill points can be spent at the skill tree to provide a form of progression that persists across the levels.
				</li>
